## Content Preservation Rule
- Never delete or modify existing content that doesn't match current rules
- Apply new rules and templates only to newly created content
- When updating files, preserve sections that don't match the template
- When in doubt, keep existing content and add new content following current rules

## Exception Cases
- Security vulnerabilities
- Critical bug fixes
- Explicitly requested deletions or modifications

## Implementation Guide
When modifying files:
1. Identify existing content
2. Add new content following current rules
3. Merge without removing non-conforming content
4. Document deviations in comments if necessary
