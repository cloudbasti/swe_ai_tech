## File Structure & Templates
- All task files should be named `tasks-XX.md` where XX is the week number
- Files should be placed in their respective week folders (`week-XX`)
- Each task file must follow the structure defined in `tasks/task-template.md`

## Content Rules
- Use proper heading hierarchy (# for title, ## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- Code blocks must specify language (```python, ```javascript, etc.)
- Include installation steps with clear commands
- List all prerequisites at the start
- Include evaluation criteria for assignments
- Add resource links at the end

## Formatting
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use backticks for inline code
- Use blockquotes for important notes
- Include examples where applicable

## Constraints 
- Create the content short and precise, the target is to install many programs and create code
- Skip what is not needed
- The parts which would be skipped can be offered in the chat in a section suggestions but not added to the files directly
