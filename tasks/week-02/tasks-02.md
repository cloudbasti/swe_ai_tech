## Part 1: Markdown Basics

## Introduction to Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It's widely used for:
- README files
- Documentation
- Technical writing
- Note-taking
- And much more!

## Key Markdown Features

### 1. Headers
Basic syntax:
```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
```

Example result:
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4

### 2. Text Formatting
Basic syntax:
```markdown
*Italic text* or _italic text_
**Bold text** or __bold text__
~~Strikethrough text~~
```

Example result:
*Italic text* or _italic text_
**Bold text** or __bold text__
~~Strikethrough text~~

### 3. Lists
Basic syntax:
```markdown
- Unordered list item
- Another item
  - Subitem (indent with 2 spaces)

1. Ordered list item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem (indent with 3 spaces)
```

Example result:
- Unordered list item
- Another item
  - Subitem (indent with 2 spaces)

1. Ordered list item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem (indent with 3 spaces)

### 4. Links and References
Basic syntax:
```markdown
[Link text](https://www.example.com)
[Link with title](https://www.example.com "Link title")

Reference-style links:
[Link text][reference]
[Another link][ref2]

[reference]: https://www.example.com
[ref2]: https://www.example.com/docs "Optional title"
```

Example result:
[Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
[Javascript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "Javascript Documentation")

Reference-style links:
Here you can find the official [python flask Documentation][reference] and also the [vue.js Documentation][ref2]. These two are web development frameworks and so being able to build software faster. There exist many other frontend frameworks and backend frameworks. 

[reference]: (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/installation/#install-flask)
[ref2]: https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction "vue js documentation"

### 5. Images
Basic syntax:
```markdown
![Alt text for image](path/to/image.png)
```

Example:
![Software Development Lifecycle](/public/week-02/tasks/software-lifecycle-dall-e-generated.png)
*Image: Software Development Lifecycle generated by DALL-E from OpenAI*

### 6. Code Blocks
To create code blocks, use triple backticks with the language name.

Basic syntax:
````markdown
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
````

Example result:
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### 7. Tables
```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
```

## Quick Guide to Cursor's AI Features

Cursor provides powerful AI assistance right in your editor. You can access these features in two main ways:
- Press `Ctrl+L` (Windows) or `Cmd+L` (Mac) to open a new chat with the AI assistant
- Press `Ctrl+G` (Windows) or `Cmd+G` (Mac) to enter generate mode

Here's how to access these features directly from your editor:

![Cursor AI Features Access](/public/week-02/tasks/Cursor-General-Options-from-Editor.png)
*Image: Accessing Cursor's AI features from the editor*

Try these examples to explore Cursor's key features:

### 1. Contextual Code Suggestions
Before you start typing, Cursor can proactively suggest relevant code based on your context. However, it's important to review these suggestions critically:

![Cursor Copilot Functionality](/public/week-02/tasks/Cursor-Copilot-Functionality.png)
*Image: Cursor's copilot suggesting code based on context before you start typing*

**Note:** Always review AI suggestions carefully. In this example, the suggestion implies that a backend developer needs to know ALL listed languages (Python AND PHP AND Java AND C#), which is incorrect. A more accurate condition would use OR operators, as knowing one backend language is typically sufficient for backend development.

### 2. Inline Code Completion
Cursor provides real-time completions as you type. Here's an example of implementing a mean squared error function:

Step 1 - Initial suggestion:
![Cursor Inline Completion Step 1](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-inline-1.png)
*Image: Cursor suggesting the mean squared error function signature as you type*

Step 2 - After accepting with Tab:
![Cursor Inline Completion Step 2](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-inline-2.png)
*Image: Cursor providing the complete mean squared error function implementation*

Press Tab to accept suggestions or use arrow keys to view alternatives. This two-step process helps you understand and verify the code being suggested before accepting the complete implementation.

### 3. Comment-Driven Generation
You can use detailed comments to describe what you want Cursor to generate. This is a powerful way to create code by describing your intent:

![Comment Driven Generation Example](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-comment-driven-generation.png)
*Image: Example of comment-driven code generation in Cursor*

Best practices for comment-driven generation:
- Be specific about the desired functionality
- Include edge cases or special conditions in your comments
- Specify any particular patterns or approaches you want to use
- Mention error handling requirements if needed

#### Integration with Project Management Tools
One powerful application of comment-driven development is its potential integration with project management tools like Jira. In theory, this workflow could:
- Automatically fetch requirements from Jira tickets
- Convert user stories and acceptance criteria into structured comments
- Generate initial code scaffolding based on ticket requirements
- Link generated code back to original tickets for traceability

For example, a Jira ticket like:
```
TICKET-123: Implement Email Validation
Description: Add email validation to user registration
Acceptance Criteria:
- Must validate common email formats
- Handle international domains
- Prevent SQL injection
- Log validation failures
```

Could automatically generate comments like:
```javascript
// Implementation for TICKET-123: Email Validation
// Requirements from Jira:
// - Create an email validation function for user registration
// - Must handle common email formats (user@domain.com)
// - Support international domain names
// - Include SQL injection prevention
// - Add logging for validation failures
// Return: boolean indicating if email is valid
```

This integration would streamline the development process by:
- Ensuring code directly addresses ticket requirements
- Maintaining consistency between documentation and implementation
- Reducing manual effort in requirement translation
- Creating clear traceability between code and tickets

Example:
```javascript
// Create a function that validates an email address using regex
// Requirements:
// - Must handle common email formats (e.g., user@domain.com)
// - Should validate TLD length (2-6 characters)
// - Must handle subdomains
// - Return true for valid emails, false for invalid ones
```

### 4. Chat for Help
Cursor's chat feature is a powerful tool for getting AI assistance with your coding tasks. Here's how a typical interaction progresses:

1. **Task Assignment**
![Cursor Chat Task Assignment](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-chat-1.png)
*Image: Giving the AI a specific coding task or requirement*

2. **Task Understanding and Planning**
![Cursor Chat Task Analysis](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-chat-2.png)
*Image: AI acknowledging the task and explaining its approach to the solution*

3. **Code Generation and Implementation**
![Cursor Chat Code Generation](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-chat-3.png)
*Image: AI generating the actual code solution based on the requirements*

Best practices for task-based interactions:
- Be clear and specific about your requirements
- Provide necessary context about your project
- Review the AI's understanding before code generation
- Ask for modifications if the generated code needs adjustments
- Use follow-up questions to refine the solution

Example task requests:
```
- "Create a function that validates user input"
- "Generate a database schema for a blog system"
- "Write a test suite for this authentication module"
- "Implement error handling for this API endpoint"
- "Refactor this code to use async/await"
```
