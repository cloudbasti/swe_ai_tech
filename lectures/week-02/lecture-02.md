## 📖 Part 1: Markdown Essentials
*Software Engineering Principles: Documentation*

### ⭐ Key Concepts
<details>
<summary>Understanding Markdown</summary>

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It's widely used for:
- README files
- Documentation
- Technical writing
- Note-taking
- And much more!

> 💡 **Tip**: Markdown is designed to be both readable in its raw form and easily convertible to HTML.
</details>

### 💻 Markdown Syntax Guide
<details>
<summary>Essential Markdown Features</summary>

#### 1. Headers
```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
```

#### 2. Text Formatting
```markdown
*Italic text* or _italic text_
**Bold text** or __bold text__
~~Strikethrough text~~
```

#### 3. Lists
```markdown
- Unordered list item
- Another item
  - Subitem (indent with 2 spaces)

1. Ordered list item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem (indent with 3 spaces)
```

#### 4. Links and References
```markdown
[Link text](https://www.example.com)
[Link with title](https://www.example.com "Link title")
```

Example:
[Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
[Javascript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "Javascript Documentation")

#### 5. Images
```markdown
![Alt text for image](path/to/image.png)
```

Example:
![Software Development Lifecycle](/public/week-02/tasks/software-lifecycle-dall-e-generated.png)
*Image: Software Development Lifecycle generated by DALL-E from OpenAI*

#### 6. Code Blocks
````markdown
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
````

#### 7. Tables
```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Use the preview feature in Cursor (`Ctrl+Shift+V` or `Cmd+Shift+V`) to see how your Markdown looks.

## 📖 Part 2: Cursor AI Features
*AI Driven Development: Enhanced Productivity*

### ⭐ Key Concepts
<details>
<summary>Understanding Cursor's AI Capabilities</summary>

Cursor provides powerful AI assistance right in your editor. You can access these features in two main ways:
- Press `Ctrl+L` (Windows) or `Cmd+L` (Mac) to open a new chat with the AI assistant
- Press `Ctrl+G` (Windows) or `Cmd+G` (Mac) to enter generate mode

Here's how to access these features directly from your editor:

*Image: Accessing Cursor's AI features from the editor*
</details>

### 💻 Core Features
<details>
<summary>Key AI Capabilities</summary>

#### 1. Contextual Code Suggestions
Before you start typing, Cursor can proactively suggest relevant code based on your context:

*Image: Cursor's copilot suggesting code based on context before you start typing*

> ⚠️ **Note:** Always review AI suggestions carefully. They might need adjustments to match your specific needs.

#### 2. Inline Code Completion
Cursor provides real-time completions as you type:

Step 1 - Initial suggestion:

*Image: Cursor suggesting the mean squared error function signature as you type*

Step 2 - After accepting with Tab:

*Image: Cursor providing the complete mean squared error function implementation*

#### 3. Comment-Driven Generation
You can use detailed comments to describe what you want Cursor to generate:

![Comment Driven Generation Example](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-comment-driven-generation.png)
*Image: Example of comment-driven code generation in Cursor*

Best practices for comment-driven generation:
- Be specific about the desired functionality
- Include edge cases or special conditions
- Specify any particular patterns or approaches
- Mention error handling requirements

#### 4. Chat for Help
The chat feature provides interactive assistance. Here's how a typical interaction progresses:

1. **Task Assignment**
![Cursor Chat Task Assignment](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-chat-1.png)
*Image: Giving the AI a specific coding task or requirement*

2. **Task Understanding and Planning**
![Cursor Chat Task Analysis](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-chat-2.png)
*Image: AI acknowledging the task and explaining its approach to the solution*

3. **Code Generation and Implementation**
![Cursor Chat Code Generation](/public/week-02/tasks/cursor-chat-3.png)
*Image: AI generating the actual code solution based on the requirements*

Best practices for chat interactions:
- Be clear and specific about requirements
- Provide necessary context
- Review and verify suggestions
- Ask follow-up questions when needed

> 💡 **Tip**: Use the chat history to track the evolution of your solution and revisit previous explanations.
