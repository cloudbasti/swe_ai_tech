## 🎯 Learning Path Connections

### Horizontal Integration (Same Week)
- **Week 2**: Documentation principles + AI assistance = Professional, AI-enhanced documentation workflow
- **Week 3**: API architecture understanding prepares for AI-assisted endpoint generation  
- **Week 4**: Combines all previous knowledge with advanced AI techniques

### Vertical Integration (Across Weeks)
- **Weeks 2→3→4**: Documentation → Architecture → AI Templates = Complete development workflow
- **AI Development Progression**: Basic AI features → Architecture understanding → Advanced AI integration
- **Software Engineering Foundation**: Documentation → Architecture → Professional practices

---

## 🔍 Content Balance Analysis

### Current Distribution:
- **Software Engineering Principles**: 1 week (Documentation)
- **AI Driven Development**: 2 weeks (Cursor features + Advanced techniques) 
- **Software Architecture**: 1 week (API design)
- **CI/CD**: 1 week (Git/GitHub)

### Future Planning Considerations:
- Need more Software Engineering Principles (testing, design patterns, etc.)
- Consider additional Architecture topics (databases, frontend architecture)
- Expand CI/CD beyond Git (automation, deployment, etc.)
