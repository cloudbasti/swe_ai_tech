# Research Topics for Further Investigation

This document outlines key areas that require further research and investigation for improving AI-assisted development workflows.

## Rules Integration & Functionality

### 1. Copilot VSCode Integration
**Research Question:** Is it possible to use rules with Copilot for VSCode?

- Investigate if VSCode Copilot supports custom rule systems
- Research available extensions or plugins that bridge rules with Copilot
- Explore configuration options for custom prompting in VSCode Copilot
- Look into workspace-specific Copilot settings and their rule integration capabilities

### 2. AI Prompting Chain Visibility
**Research Question:** How can you make visible the AI prompting chain, from prompt to rules, to created prompt what is finally being transmitted to the AI?

- Investigate debugging tools for AI prompt chains
- Research logging mechanisms for prompt transformation pipelines
- Explore visualization tools for prompt engineering workflows
- Look into middleware solutions that can intercept and display prompt modifications
- Study existing tools that provide transparency in AI prompt processing

### 3. Rules and Prompt Techniques Combination
**Research Question:** Is it useful to combine rules with prompt techniques? If so, what about examples with few-shot prompting?

- Research effectiveness of rule-based systems combined with few-shot prompting
- Investigate best practices for integrating:
  - Chain-of-thought prompting with rules
  - Few-shot examples within rule frameworks
  - Template-based prompting enhanced by rules
- Study case studies of successful rule + prompt technique combinations
- Explore potential conflicts or synergies between different approaches

## Restrictions & Rights Management for Rules

### 3. Rights Management and Filesystem Restrictions
**Research Question:** How to create proper rights management within rules and also restrictions on the filesystem?

- Investigate file system permission models for rule-based systems
- Research access control mechanisms for AI development tools
- Explore sandbox environments for rule execution
- Study best practices for:
  - Read/write permissions for different rule types
  - Directory-specific rule applications
  - User role-based rule access
  - Audit trails for rule modifications

### 4. Rules, Rights, and Git Branch Integration
**Research Question:** How to combine rules with rights and potentially git branches?

- Research branch-specific rule applications
- Investigate:
  - Rules that activate based on current git branch
  - Permission models tied to branch protection rules
  - Workflow automation combining git hooks with rule systems
- Explore integration possibilities with:
  - GitHub/GitLab branch protection
  - Merge request/pull request rule validation
  - Branch-specific development environments

## Context Enhancement & Local Resources

### 1. Local Software Documentation
**Research Question:** Get software documentation of your stack locally to save internet request time

- Investigate tools for offline documentation management:
  - Dash (macOS), Zeal (Windows/Linux) for API documentation
  - DevDocs offline capabilities
  - Custom documentation scraping and indexing solutions
- Research methods for:
  - Automated documentation updates
  - Integration with IDE/editor environments
  - Search and indexing of local documentation
  - Version-specific documentation management

### 2. Local GitHub Issues and Requests
**Research Question:** Mention specific GitHub pages with issues and requests (for bugs for example) - could you pull these also to local?

- Investigate GitHub API integration for local issue caching:
  - GitHub CLI tools for issue management
  - Custom scripts for issue synchronization
  - Database solutions for local issue storage
- Research tools for:
  - Offline issue browsing and search
  - Integration with development workflows
  - Automated issue updates and notifications
  - Cross-repository issue tracking

### 3. Stack Overflow Integration for Specific Languages
**Research Question:** What about specific Stack Overflow for the required language?

- Research Stack Overflow API integration possibilities:
  - Language-specific question caching
  - Tag-based content filtering and storage
  - Integration with development environments
- Investigate existing tools for:
  - Offline Stack Overflow browsing
  - IDE plugins for Stack Overflow integration
  - Automated solution suggestion based on error patterns
  - Local indexing of relevant Q&A content

## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority
1. Rules and Prompt Techniques Combination (immediate impact on development workflow)
2. Local Software Documentation (significant time savings)

### Medium Priority
3. AI Prompting Chain Visibility (important for debugging and optimization)
4. Local GitHub Issues and Requests (workflow improvement)

### Research Phase
5. Copilot VSCode Integration (dependent on platform capabilities)
6. Rights Management and Filesystem Restrictions (complex implementation)
7. Rules, Rights, and Git Branch Integration (advanced workflow automation)
8. Stack Overflow Integration (nice-to-have enhancement)

## Next Steps

1. **Literature Review:** Search for existing research and tools in each area
2. **Tool Evaluation:** Test available solutions for identified needs
3. **Proof of Concept:** Develop minimal viable implementations for high-priority items
4. **Integration Testing:** Evaluate how different solutions work together
5. **Documentation:** Create guides and best practices based on findings
